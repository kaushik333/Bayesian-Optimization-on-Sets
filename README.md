# Bayesian-Optimization-on-Sets

Bayesian optimization is used to approximate black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. It has proven useful in several applications, including hyperparameter optimization neural architecture search and material design. Classic BO assumes a search region ![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?X%20%5Csubset%20%5Cmathcal%7BR%7D%5E%7Bd%7D) and a scalar black-box function f evaluated in the presence of additive noise.
